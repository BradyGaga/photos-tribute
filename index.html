        <h3 id=headline>The following pictures are missed the most (you'll just have to imagine them in your mind's eye):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Scotland Roadie</strong> -The sun throws fiery sunset colours onto the sky over rugged emerald terrain, all reflected in the shine of a Ford Mondeo perched at the top of the rural campsite.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>[redacted]</strong> -An aerial view of patchwork fields on a sunny day over [redacted], as seen from inside the cockpit of a chinook.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Amsterdam Trip</strong> -A silhouette of a Dutch storybook windmill that casts a dramatic shadow on the tall grass along the lakefront.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Amsterdam Trip</strong> -Lit by a single lamppost at night, an <a id="car-link" href="https://biro.nl/en/" target="_blank">already tiny car</a> is dwarfed by the bicyles lining the canal's fence. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lakes District</strong> -A Highland Cow looks up from it's grazing on the hillside, away from the view it could have of the lake and the town that the viewer instead would enjoy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Various Locations</strong> -Travel selfies with a cute boy. &#60;&#47;3
            </li>
        </ul>
