First website by BradyGaga, for FreeCodeCamp through The Odin Project.

The brief was for a tribute page as per the instructions at this url;
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

While completing this I put into practice the theory from
FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

I learned about favicons and shortcut icons in noticing the absence of 
one from my tab while all other tabs had it while working on the code.

I learned that not all browsers treat code the same. I did try a reset 
css form, but as the site is simple found it easier to not use one as 
I could not see an issue when testing the site in Firefox as well as
Chrome.

I am proud of how responsive my site is, having tested it in a simulated 
phone screen while getting to know the dev tools available on Chrome.

I did want more interactivity but settled with the site as it is before
spending my whole life perfecting it and never publishing it.

I hope you enjoy!
